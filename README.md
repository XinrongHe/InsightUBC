# InsightUBC

This project is a full-stack web application that I developed as part of an introduction to software engineering class in UBC.

Skills Used: Node.js, Javascript, Typescript, Mocha, jQuery, HTML, CSS

It allows users to parse courses data from JSON file and rooms data from HTML file and process it using a query language. For more information please visit the [course webpage](https://sites.google.com/view/ubc-cpsc310-20w2-intro-to-se).
